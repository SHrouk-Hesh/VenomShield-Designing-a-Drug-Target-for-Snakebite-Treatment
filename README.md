# VenomShield-Designing-a-Drug-Target-for-Snakebite-Treatment
Introducing VenomShield, an innovative research project focused on designing a drug target to prevent the interaction between the toxin in snake venom and acetylcholinesterase. Snakebite, classified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization, poses a significant health risk with acute neuromuscular weakness and respiratory involvement being the most clinically important neurotoxic effects.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Understanding Snake Venom Neurotoxicity:** VenomShield aims to delve into the patterns of weakness, respiratory involvement, and symptom evolution resulting from snake venom neurotoxicity. The project explores the variability of these effects based on snake species and the type of neurotoxicity observed.

2. **Identifying Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors:** The fatal toxin produced by venomous snakes, like the green mamba, acts as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. VenomShield seeks to identify potential inhibitors of this enzyme to prevent the harmful effects of the venom on the neuromuscular system.

3. **Creating a Therapeutic Target with PDB Structure 1ACJ:** The project utilizes the PDB structure 1ACJ to create a drug target that blocks the interaction between the venom toxin and acetylcholinesterase. This target aims to disrupt the venom's ability to inhibit the enzyme, thus preserving its function in breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

4. **Molecular Docking with Autodock Vina:** VenomShield employs molecular docking techniques with Autodock Vina to investigate the affinity of Tacrine, a known acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, to the enzyme. The affinity of Tacrine will be assessed, and the project will also explore other potential inhibitors that successfully inhibit acetylcholinesterase.

**Impact and Significance:**

VenomShield stands at the forefront of snakebite treatment research, aiming to develop effective therapeutic interventions for snakebite victims. By identifying potential inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and designing a drug target to block the venom-enzyme interaction, the project seeks to enhance the treatment options for individuals affected by snakebites.

The outcomes of VenomShield could have profound implications for snakebite management, advancing the development of targeted drugs and therapies. Ultimately, the project's goal is to contribute to the improvement of patient outcomes and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with snakebites, especially those involving neurotoxic effects.

In the spirit of combating neglected tropical diseases, VenomShield aims to shine a light on snakebite treatment, offering new hope and potential breakthroughs in the fight against this significant global health challenge. Through our dedication to research and innovation, we envision a future where snakebite victims can find refuge behind the protective shield of VenomShield.


**Conclusion & Future Work**

In our case study we concluded that, a therapeutic target with pdb structure 1ACJ to prevent the interaction between the toxin in snake venom and acetylcholinesterase. In addition, using Autodock Vina, follow the instructions for Molecular Docking as well as reporting the affinity of Tacrine for Acetylcholinesterase, as well as finding more inhibitors other than Tacrine that were successful in inhibiting Acetylcholinesterase. As a conclusion, in our case study, we designed a pharmacological target to prevent the poison in snake venom from interacting with acetylcholinesterase. In our future work, more research into these fascinating molecules and their diverse actions would not only help us improve management of neurotoxic envenoming but may also enable their use as potential treatments for infections, cancer, and various neurological disorders.
